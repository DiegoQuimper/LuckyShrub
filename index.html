          Based in Tuscon, Arizona, Lucky Shrub is a medium-sized garden design firm that specializes in garden design
          and creation, maintenance and landscaping. The company also runs a small plant nursery that sells indoor and
          outdoor plants, making them a one-stop shop for clients to "transform any space into an oasis you can be proud
          of".
          Lucky Shrub was started by a husband and wife team, Jason and Maria, who share a long-time love for plants.
          Jason is the garden architect. He creates and oversees all designs while managing his team of landscapers.

        <h2>The Design Process</h2>
        <p>
          All gardens are different and all our designs are unique, therefore the following information is a guide.
          Please do also take a look at our flipbook which is a really comprehensive guide to the way we present our
          design concepts.
          It is incredibly visual and details what we do in the way of illustrative masterplans, sketches, 3D
          visualisations, lighting plans and more.
        </p>
